# /add-new-skill

Use this workflow when working on **add-new-skill** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new skill to the repository, including documentation and agent config if cross-harness.

## Common Files

- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/*/agents/openai.yaml`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create or update skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md with skill documentation.
- If cross-harness, add .agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md and/or .cursor/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md.
- If agent config is needed, add .agents/skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml.
- If needed, register the skill in install manifests or documentation.

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.

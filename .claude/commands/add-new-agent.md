# /add-new-agent

Use this workflow when working on **add-new-agent** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new agent to the repository, including documentation and registration.

## Common Files

- `agents/*.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- `rules/common/agents.md`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create agents/<agent-name>.md with agent documentation.
- Register the agent in AGENTS.md.
- If needed, add agent config in .codex/agents/<agent-name>.toml or similar.
- If needed, update rules/common/agents.md or other rules files.

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.

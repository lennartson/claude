## Safe Template (Error Handling + State Detection)

Use this as a starting point for any new macro:

```applescript
on run
    try
        -- Check if target app is running
        tell application "System Events"
            set isRunning to (exists process "TargetApp")
        end tell

        if not isRunning then
            tell application "TargetApp" to activate
            delay 1.0
        else
            tell application "TargetApp" to activate
            delay 0.3
        end if

        tell application "System Events"
            tell process "TargetApp"
                -- YOUR AUTOMATION HERE
                -- Use try blocks for each action
                -- Detect state before toggling
            end tell
        end tell

    on error errMsg number errNum
        display notification "Macro failed: " & errMsg with title "StreamDock"
    end try
end run
```

## Tips

- **Test with osascript first**: `osascript script.applescript` before compiling
- **Delays**: 0.3s after app activate, 0.2s between menu clicks, 0.5s after full screen transitions
- **State detection**: Use `AXFullScreen`, `AXMinimized`, `AXMenuItemMarkChar` attributes
- **Error notifications**: Use `display notification` for user feedback on failures
- **Avoid loops with delays**: Burns CPU. Use idle handlers for continuous monitoring.
- **Sequoia users**: May need to re-authorize Accessibility monthly
